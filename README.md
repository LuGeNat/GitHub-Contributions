# GitHub Contributions

GitHub Contributions is a small program that fetches your contributions from the GitHub contribution page `https://github.com/users/<username>/contributions` and displays them in various ways. The app is currently in development and will support:

- A main app window
- A notification center widget
- A menu bar icon

I am working on the macOS app and have planned to add an iOS app.
