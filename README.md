# GitHub Contributions

GitHub Contributions is a small program that fetches your contributions from GitHubs contributions page `https://github.com/users/<username>/contributions` and displays them in various ways. The app is currentyl in development and will support:

- A main app window
- A notification center widget
- A menu bar icon

I am currently working on the macOS app, but will add an iOS app.
